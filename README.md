# Replit100DaysofCode

Python is a great language for beginners and as a beginner I have taken it upon myself to complete the 100 days of code challenge with Replit. 

Python is easy to learn, has an active support community, and offers versatlity with regards to opportunities in web development, games, and data science. 

I will be creating files with the instructions for each days task, some tasks will be really easy, and others more challenging. Remember this is beginners code, so maybe you will find bugs, or perhaps you might find more efficient ways to solve the problem. I am happy to learn from feedback. So leave comments where ever you feel is necessary.
